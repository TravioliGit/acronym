# A Crazy Reminder of Names You Misplaced

Frontend and backend code for our web browser plugin and outlook add-on to allow for the automatic expansion of Ministry of Defence acronyms in received documents and emails.

## Development

To get started with local development you will need the ability to use a bash terminal on your development environment (eg VSCode), and the following installed on your machine:

- [Node & NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Node Version Manager (NVM)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [Yeoman](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) and the [Yeoman generator for Office Add-ins](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/develop/yeoman-generator-overview). To install these tools globally, run the following command via the command prompt:
`npm install -g yo generator-office`
Even if you've previously installed the Yeoman generator, we recommend you update your package to the latest version from npm.
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or your preferred code editor
- Outlook 2016 or later on Windows (connected to a Microsoft 365 account) or Outlook on the web
- A GitHub account
